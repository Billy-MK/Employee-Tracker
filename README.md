# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project is intended to demonstrate my ability to work with mysql databases and npm packages in node. I created a CRUD database management system using a database with three tables, "departments", "roles", and "employees". The command line application can create, read, update, and delete data from these databases using javascript code and npm packages.

## Usage

The command-line application will have prompts asking what you would like to do. Navigate these prompts using arrow keys, enter, and typed responses.
